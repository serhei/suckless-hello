hello - example program using Suckless packaging style
------------------------------------------------------
hello is exactly like any other 'hello world' program, just packaged
differently.

Requirements
------------
In order to build hello you need a C compiler.

Installation
------------
Optionally, edit config.h to customize your greeting.

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (hello is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install hello (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

Running hello
-------------
If there were complications to running hello, they would be documented
here. But you just run:

    hello

See the man page for additional details.
